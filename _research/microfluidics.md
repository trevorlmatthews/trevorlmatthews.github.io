## Senior Mechanical Engineering Capstone Project

The project goal was to design a high-throughput, high-efficiency microfluidic chip capable of isolating single-cell interactions and is compatible with super resolution instruments. The final design utilized dynamic lateral displacement to trap single-cells within an array of thousands of microfluidic traps. Initial results showed 78% trapping efficiency within a sample population of neutrophil cells.

This project won the departmental runner-up award among the 55 projects overall.
